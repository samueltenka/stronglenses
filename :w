- How do cosmologists go from survey images to crops?
	- Automated?
	- Grad students?
		- Reason for asking is because for final demonstration, would like to be able to scan sky, locate strong lenses

- Scale invariance (or variance) of strong lenses themselves
	- How bad is it?
	- Will our 64x64 scanning encompass all possible strong lense sizes?
	- Rotation, translational invariance? Background context?

- What is the over-arching plan for this project?
	- Assuming we build a good classifier, what's next? What do we do with it?
	- At what point would Brian deem results good enough to publish?
