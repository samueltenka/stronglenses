    descr: Strong Lens Detection via Neural Net.

           We'll classify deepfield astronomical
           images by whether or not they contain
           a strong gravitational lens. This project
           is part of the Michigan Data Science
           Team's 2016 activities.

# 0. Project Outline

# 0.0 Usage 

The TL;DR is:

To set up the system, ask Sam. This involves
data scraping and editing a config file. Then
the following commands should work when one
is in working directory `stronglenses`:

    python -m engine.visualize     /* display samples from the visualization set   */
    python -m engine.train_nn 20   /* train a net for 20 epochs (on the train set) */
    python -m engine.train_nn 0    /* test a net (on the test set)                 */
    python -m engine.view_history  /* inspect training history                     */
    python -m engine.view_curves   /* generate yield and confidence curves         */

The latter two commands save to subdirectory `discussion/figures`.

## 0.2. Directory Structure

Our project directory structure, simplified of clutter, is
as follows. Asterisks denote skeletal files. Our data, model
checkpoints, and training logs we keep elsewhere, as specified
in `config.json`. Each worker on this project will likely
have a different directory structure external to the following,
so we leave as adjustable the paths in `config.json`. See
`config.json.example` for a config file that works for Sam.
