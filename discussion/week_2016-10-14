descr: Questions for Dr. Brian Nord for strong lens project


# 0. Action Items

	@nord: Where can we access to code for simulations?
	@pi224:  
	@sam: Train neural network for preliminary results. 

# 1. Questions & Update

## 1.0. Data

	@nord: How realistic are the simulations? What assumptions
	do they make about atmospheric distortion, about arrangement,
        spectra, and shapes of sources? About distributions of masses?
	Etc.

	@nord: What symmetries and densities can we expect in our data?
	Explicitly: how much scale, rotational, and translational invariance
	should we expect? How sparsely distributed are lightsources in the
        sky? What scales will we need to keep in mind (#pixels... #images...)
        Could global context be important? 

	@nord: Our simulation data contains centered crops of potential
	strong lenses. How would this translate to the non-simulated case?
	What are current methods for centering and cropping potential
	strong lenses (automated... grad students...)? 

## 1.1. Related Work

	@nord: Is there any prior or related work we should look into?
	For instance, we found a paper on strong lens detection via neural 
	nets (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/cpd_final.pdf). How many
	players? Differences and similarities in the space of projects
	and approaches? How can we reach out to other workers?

## 1.2. Project Plan

	We've read 1 paper on classification architecture,
	implemented some neural nets in Keras, and
	prepared the data for neural net training. We haven't yet
	started training though.

	@nord: Detection and classification are related but distinct problems.
	Which is our ultimate goal? Which should we strive for in our projects'
	initial stages?

	@nord: What is the over-arching plan for this project? A major
	stage will be building an accurate classifier. What's next?
	How will we integrate it into existing workflows?

	@nord: Validation methodology: what metrics should we optimize for?
	Beyond what threshold will our work be useful? Publishable?

	@nord: Could we meet once every two weeks?
