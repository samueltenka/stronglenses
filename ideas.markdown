    DONE say how many params each model is.

    write history after each epoch (so change model.train)

    contact Dr. Nord about using noisy or real data for 
    a more challenging task (we have 99.5% test accuracy
    at 80% yield).

    train 2-block resnet (orthogonally, try more channels) 
    to improve accuracy at 100% yield.
    
    plot (accuracy, confidence) vs yield.

    plot ROC curves of all 8 classifiers (1+3+1 nets, 3 non-nets).
    
    visualize the importances of raw features in neural nets;
    compare all 8 classifiers in terms of such visualizations.
