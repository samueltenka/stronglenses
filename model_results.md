    descr: Strong Lens Detection via Neural Net.

           We'll classify deepfield astronomical
           images by whether or not they contain
           a strong gravitational lens. This project
           is part of the Michigan Data Science
           Team's 2016 activities.

After 20 epochs (~10 seconds each), our MLP model has:

    loss=0.1727, acc=0.9495
